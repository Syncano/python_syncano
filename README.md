# Syncano v4.0

## Usage examples

### Authentication

    ```python
    import syncano
    connection = syncano.connect(email='', password='')
    ```

### Accessing models
Each model is generated based on API schema and is available **after** connection initialization.

    ```python
    Instance = connection.models.Instance
    ```


### Queries

    ```python
    # Get all instances
    Instance.please.list()
    Instance.please.all()

    # Get only two instances
    Instance.please.limit(2).list()

    # Get raw JSON
    Instance.please.raw().list()

    # Get instance named syncano
    Instance.please.get('syncano')
    Instance.please.detail('syncano')

    # Update instance named syncano
    Instance.please.update('syncano', data={'description': 'new one'})

    # Delete instance named syncano
    Instance.please.delete('syncano')

    # Create instance named test
    Instance.please.create(name='test', description='test')
    ```


### Model instance methods

    ```python
    # Create
    instance = Instance(name='syncano', description='test')
    instance.save()

    instance = Instance()
    instance.name = 'syncano'
    instance.description = 'test'
    instance.save()

    # Update
    instance.description = 'new one'
    instance.save()

    # Delete
    instance.delete()
    ```

### Related models
Based on HATEOAS links attached to each model ORM is creating relations to all of them.

    ```python
    instance = Instance.please.get('syncano')
    instance.admins
    instance.admins.raw()
    instance.admins.create()
    instance.admins.delete(4)
    ```
